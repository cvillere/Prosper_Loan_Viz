Summary - in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data
          visualization and add any context that can help readers
          understand it


Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to
         the visualization after collecting feedback

Feedback -
1) Labeling the x and y axes more clearly. I could tell their were categories,
but what we were looking at wasn't clear.

2) The large number of debt consolidation loans is interesting, in addition to
all the different categories of loans people take out.

3) The design looked good, but I think the design looks good. Be sure to use
better labeling to make the chart more clear.

4) When the animation gets to 2014, it skips back down to 2012 and then down
to 2007 and circles back up to 2014. See if you can eliminate the intermittent
skip and simply return the animation back to 2007.
